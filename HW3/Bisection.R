#' HW3: Bisection.
#'
#' In this exercise, you will implement a functional on your own: a root-finding algorithm called the bisection method.
#' For details, check the wikipedia page for 'Bisection Method': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method
#'
#' 1. Implement the bisection method using iteration and the scaffold given below.
#'    Argument `f` is the function of which we want to find the root.
#'    Argument `a` and `b` are two evaluated points.
#'    Argument `n` is the max number of iterations.
#'    Argument `tol` is the desired tolerence.
## Do not modify this line!

bisection <- function(f, a, b, n = 1000, tol = 1e-7) {
  # If the signs of the function at the evaluated points, a and b, stop the function and return message.
  if (!(f(a) < 0) && (f(b) > 0)) {
    stop('signs of f(a) and f(b) differ')
  } else if ((f(a) > 0) && (f(b) < 0)) {
    stop('signs of f(a) and f(b) differ')
  }
  
  for (i in 1:n) {
    c <- (a + b) / 2 # Calculate midpoint
    
    # If the function equals 0 at the midpoint or the midpoint is below the desired tolerance, stop the 
    # function and return the root.
    if ((f(c) == 0) || ((b - a) / 2) < tol) {
      return(c)
    }
    
    # If another iteration is required, 
    # check the signs of the function at the points c and a and reassign
    # a or b accordingly as the midpoint to be used in the next iteration.
    ifelse(sign(f(c)) == sign(f(a)), 
           a <- c,
           b <- c)
  }
  # If the max number of iterations is reached and no root has been found, 
  # return message and end function.
  print('Too many iterations')
}



#' 2. Modify the function `bisection` such that if the signs of the function at the evaluated points are the same, throw an error with message
#'    `"The signs of f evaluated at the endpoints are the same."`.
#'    Also if the max number of iterations is reached and no root has been found, throw an error with message `"Max number of iterations reached."`.

    stop('signs of f(a) and f(b) differ')
  } else if ((f(a) > 0) && (f(b) < 0)) {
    stop('signs of f(a) and f(b) differ')
  }
  else if (f(a)==f(b)){
    stop('The signs of f evaluated at the endpoints are the same.')
  }

      return(c)
    }
