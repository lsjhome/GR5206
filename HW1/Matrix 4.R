# HW1: linear algebra
#
# 1. Assign to `a` a 3x3 matrix filled by row with numbers between 1 and 9.
# 2. Assign to `ca` the matrix corresponding to the upper triangulart of the cholesky decomposition of `a`.
# In other words, find `ca` such that `t(ca) %*% ca = a`. (hint: look at the function `chol`)
# 3. Assign to `eva` the first eigenvector of `a`. (hint: look at the function `eigen`)
# 4. Assign to `iea` the inverse of the matrix composed of the eigenvectors of `a` (hint: look at the function `solve`)
# 5. Assign to `ra` the rank of `a`. (hint: look at the function `qr`)
